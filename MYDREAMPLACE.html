<p> Switzerland still remains my biggest dream. As Switzerland is one of the most attractive vacation destinations today in the world 
because of its lakes, beautiful mountain ranges, snowfall and many interesting places that make it a perfect tourist attraction.
Why is Switzerland different and my dream destination? It may come as a surprise to many that how a small country like Switzerland is
 one of the biggest tourist attraction on the earth. Located on the continent of Europe. Although known for its unique and economic
 banking system, its is more famous for its numerous lakes, villages and the high peaks of the Alps.
The capital of Switzerland is Zurich. The country is uniquely known for its Ski resorts and hiking trail so hikers
 have no cause for alarm. In fact, it is regarded as one of the biggest cities in the world because of its modern outlook,
 quite busy and business oriented. Its cities contain medieval quarter with landmarks such as capital Bern's zytyglogge 
clock tower and Lucerne's wooden chapel bridge.</p>

<p><h1 style="font-family: ink free;"> Second places is Korea. I like to go this place because that place is very interested .
<br> The place are most place i want to go because that place will change every season. Which is autum, winter, spring and summer. 
<br>It is so beutiful. The interweaving of heritage and modern elements in Seoul makes it one of the most attractive tourist 
<br>destinations in the world. The city proves that contemporary architecture like N Seoul Tower can exist in harmony with 
<br>traditional markets like Namdaemun Market and Insadong. This synergy allows visitors to travel through history, and 
<br>there are several major attractions in Seoul that enliven the past and the present.
