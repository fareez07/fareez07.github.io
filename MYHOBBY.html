<p> <h1 style="font-family: Pristina;">Hobbies are very important for a person, without any hobbies our life will not be as colored as 
it should be. There are many things we can do as our hobbies, such as taking pictures, playing musical instruments, reading and doing 
sports activities. Often, I am always busy spending my time with my hobbies. When I’m in the blue, I’ll also do my hobbies to cheer
 myself up. For me, a hobby is a way for us to show a crowd of people what kind
of people we are, a hobby requires devotion. Hobbies will not be perfect without practice!
I love every thing about my hobby. If I was alone, my hobby would be there to accompany me. 
So, here are some of my favorite hobbies.
<P><h1 style="font-family: Pristina;">This is my favorite thing to do when i have a free time</P>

<br>Hiking is one way for me to release my stress in addition to running away from the hustle and bustle of the capital.
<br>Starting from the bottom,we will be treated to the greenery of nature and then the beautiful scenery after making it 
<br>to the top. At that time, all the tiredness was worth it.The atmosphere at the top actually promises its own 
<br>tranquility. Furthermore, with clean and cool air when in the forest route or peak, the mind will feel calmer. 
<br>In fact, all work or life burdens feel lost in an instant.

<br>
<br>For me, playing futsal & badminton is my favorite sport because it’s part of my life and I can not live without it.
<br>Since I was a little boy, I started to play futsal & badminton in the school team and also 
<br>with my friends in the neighborhood.it is my hobby whenever I have free time.
<br>This sport also helps me to relax and be confident when I have stress and frustration.

<br>
<br>I also like dawing when have free time because it can increase my concentration, memory and patience.
<br>From the result of painting we will definitely get its own satisfaction, because we can see the work of color that we spill 
<br>into the media that we draw. I like to paint because it gives peace and satisfaction to myself.

<br>
<br>During free time,I also like With mobile photography and short videography and edit my photo in apps ligtroom because 
<br>this hobby will make my eyes and mind will be more open. I will more 'see' 
<br>the surrounding conditions and also the condition of our nature. 
<br>The mind will also be more open than before, you begin to be able to see sides of life from
<br> several angles and perspectives as when you try to photograph an object. Surely our 
<br>lives will also be more positive isn't it?
<br>If you want see my photo or short video editting just go to my instagram @fareezarmin_

<br>action games.Sometimes me and a friend of friends will also try our luck in a tournament 
<br>and the best achievement qualifies for the grandfinal stage.
